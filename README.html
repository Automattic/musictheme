<h1 id="musicthemetheme">Music Theme theme</h1>

<p>This theme is designed to showcase what Music Theme can do with regards to themes. It is intended as a work in progress, at least until v1 of the new editor (and maybe beyond).</p>

<h1 id="blockfocused">Block focused</h1>

<p>If something isn&#8217;t a block yet, this theme will not have it. As each block happens, the theme will gain that functionality.</p>

<h1 id="stylingjustlikemusictheme">Styling just like Music Theme</h1>

<p>The idea of the default look for this theme is to as closely replicate that of the Music Theme editor output as possible. As a result the focus is on that styling not creating a new look.. yet. As things grow, we may have styles and go further into what the theme can have&#8230; who knows.</p>
