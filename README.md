## FAQ

**How do I change the default page header colors?**

In the page editor, you can change the page header color by selecting a color template from the Page Attributes section of Document Settings:

![Document Settings](https://cloudup.com/files/iva6xfO0QEo/download)

Alternatively, you may select the ""Hide Page Header" template to hide the post header altogether, and use a full-width cover image block as your page header instead.

**How do I change the background color for cover image blocks?**

The default background color for cover image blocks is pink, but  there are a few color variations available. To use them, open the block settings and enter one of the following colors into the ["Additional CSS Class"](http://cld.wthms.co/1cThcZ) field:

- `white`
- `black`
- `gray` or `grey`
